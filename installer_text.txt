Agitated Intrusion Prevention System is for businesses of any scale of which want to prevent the leaking of information from sniffing software.  This product is not intended to protect against logic bombs or malicious trojans that are not using the sessions layer (network,) and this can be detrimental to a business.  For this reason, I recommend the running and operation of a virus/trojan/heruistic removal tool like Norton or AVG, an malware removal tool, and also, if you have the money, the hiring of a security IT professional and a guard to oversee your business' security.  The Agitated Intrusion Prevention System software will attempt to stop any logic bombs and any applications that wish to steal valuable information.  In order to set up the configuration so that you can designate which applications are allowed to operate freely, of which should be allowed to freely interact on the WAN (the internet) or the LAN (local area network.), you must modify IPS.conf.  Before running or testing out this software, it is highly recommended you add your list of approved programs that may run on your Windows OS.  The list must follow this format: name_of_process.extension,name_of_process_number_two.exe,name_of_process_number_three.exe,
Capitalization matters and this software will not work if you get it wrong!  So in other words, have the process name and extension followed by a comma.  The IPS.conf file is comma delimited. Furthermore, the last process mentioned on that list must also have a comma at the end.  Do not add any unnecessary characters such as spaces or new lines.
Here is a working example:
Chrome.exe,steam.exe,
